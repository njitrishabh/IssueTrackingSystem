# IssueTrackingSystem
Created a Web app for an issue tracking system, developed using ASP.NET MVC Framework.

An issue consists of the following basic properties:

1. Title

2. Status

3. Description

4. Severity

5. Assignee

6. DueDate

A user can create a new issue and view it afterwards.
All issues are persisted in the SQL Server Express LocalDB for retrieval, using a .NET Framework data-access technology known as the Entity
Framework to create Model classes using the Code First approach.
